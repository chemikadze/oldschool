Choosing a joseki:
Since josekis work effectively in a certain direction, examine
positions at adjacent corners and sides before choosing a joseki.
The opposite corner matters only if a ladder is involved. Some
guidelines:
1. Have support for a fight - A high position provides support,
a low position does not.
2. Take the side with most value.
2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.
2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.
3. Consider strategic balance.
4. Get sente, if there are more big points on the board.
5. If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one
with a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you
don't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.

How to learn joseki:
If you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want
to learn, don't try to remember every single branching, you find
here. Look first for the main and correct variations, which are
marked out with a '*', and try to remember the most easy ones
of them. You don't need to know each branching you find here.
When you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the
middle- and end-game.
Use a new learned joseki in your real games, immediately after
you learned it, until you can vizualize it coming onto the board
in a rush, without trying to stress your memory in search of
each next joseki-move.
If something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up the
variations of deviations, special strategies, trick plays and
mistakes here. To understand, why there are only for special
situations or mistakes anytime, compare their results with the
results of good variations in nearby branchings instead of looking
at their results for themselves. Open this file twice to put
two results beside each other on your screen.

San-San = Sam-Sam = San-San = 3-3 Point
---------------------------------------------

The san-san (3-3) point, emphasizing territory at the expense
of influence (especially following an approach at 'a'). 

All joseki for the 3-3 point are relatively simple.

White approaches are 'a *' to 'c *'. White 'b *' to 'e' are played
when the top side is favored (such as an extension).

Kata-tsuki (shoulder hit)
--------------------------

The shoulder-hit is the traditional answer to the 3-3.

The direction of Black 3 depends on the positions on the side.

Crawling once may be the premise for a follow-up move of sliding
with a knight's move in the opposite direction. If Black plays
3 at 'a' (to the right), the follow-on knight's move is then
played at the top. Black's knight's move reduces territory potential
on the side it is played. 

Given a White stone at top, White 2 would be a mistake. In such
a case, White should have played an extension from that stone,
rather than White 2.

Black joseki continues with 'a *'. Black 'b' and 'c' show a special
strategy.

For variations of Black playing elsewhere, see the 4-4 point
branch.

Komoku = Somok = Xiao~mu` = 3-4 Point

The komoku (3-4) point is the traditional corner enclosure move.
White approaches with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd *'. 

'e' covers enclosure (shimari) joseki.

White 'f', 'g' and 'h' are special strategies, usually against
the Chinese Fuseki.

'i' is not joseki, but simply an invasion to take the corner
after Black made a shimari-less moyo on top disabling the other
moves.

The small knight move is the basic approach move to the 3-4 point
stone. It has been continually used for over four centuries.
There are limitless variations, with new moves constantly being
discovered. White 2 opens the door to a treaure store of joseki.

Black responds with 'a *', 'b *', 'c', 'd *', 'e *', 'f' *, 'g
*', 'h *', 'i *', 'j', 'k' or plays elsewhere 'n'.
'a *' is the Shusaku joseki.
Black 'l' indicates a special strategy 
based upon favorable local position.
The variations after 'h' are manyfold, so this branching is as
complicated as the avalanche or taisha joseki.

'k' is somewhat a trick play. Black must have the ladder.

'm' is a trick play.

Black 3, the famous Shusaku diagonal move, is a steady way of
responding to White's kakari. Black can now aim to press against
the lone White stone with 'a'.

White's possible local responses are 'a *' through 'd' or 'h'.

Keima = Narincha = Fei = Knight's Move
---------------------------------------

The knight's move of Black 3 is a quiet response to White's kakari.
It is not as solid as the diagonal play but it is more flexible,
since Black can make a wider extension along the right side.

The main difference between the diagonal play and the knight's
move is that White has the option of attaching at 'a *'. White
'b' through 'd' are other options, depending upon strategic considerations.

Variation 5 illustrates White playing elsewhere.

The primary objective of Black 3 is to ensure his own safety
rather than attack White. If White is thick at the bottom, Black
3 serves to forestall an attack while erasing that thickness.
That this is a negative attitude is undeniable.

White's local responses include 'a' through 'c'. Playing elsewhere

--------------------------------------------------------------

This is the severest attacking move, emphasizing Black's advantage
from playing first in the corner. The feature of the one-space
pincer is that it does not permit White to swtich lightly elsewhere.
Many top-flight professionals are fond of this move.

White's possible responses are 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e
*' to 'f'. 'f' is not joseki.

White 'g' is sometimes seen in amateur games, and is not joseki.

Nikken Basami = Dukan Hyeopgong = E`r Jia = 2-Space Low Pincer
---------------------------------------------------------------

The low two-space pincer used to be the most popular. With modern
Go emphasis on influence, the two-space high pincer has replaced
it.

Possible White reponses range from 'a', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *',
'e *' to 'g *', or elsewhere 'h *'. White must have the ladder
to play 'd' or play elsewhere (h8).

Note, in contrast to the one-space pincer, the one-space jump
(shown at 'i') is not joseki.

'j' and 'k' are mistakes.

k11, j10, i9, h8, g7, f6, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1

outcomes:
a1 - White pincer at top; White gets out
b2, c3 - different outcomes
d4 - White takes the right
e5 - White gets out, takes part of the corner
f6 - White takes the right
g7 - initial loss, generally White takes the right

---------------------------------------------------------------

Black 1 is a pincer play said to have been developed by the 4th
Honinbo Dosaku (1645-1702). This move maintains overall balance
while attacking the White kakari stone. It is often used when
there is a White stone on the top-left star-point.

White's responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *'.'f'
or g', and include playing elsewhere 'h *'.

White may need the ladder to play 'c'.

White reply at 'i' comes from a 19th century Japanese game.

'j' was played professionally.

'k' is possible.

The two-space high pincer is most common. This pincer typifies
modern Go, as it maintains balance between territory and influence,
offers a plethora of options, and has few weaknesses.

White responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *',
'f *', 'g', 'h *', 'i *', 'j *', 'k *' or 'p'. White plays elsewhere
with 'l *'.
White 'm' shows White trying to live at top.

White 'n' is not joseki.

'o' is a big mistake.

The three-space high pincer is relatively recent (since the 1950s).
It is not often played, and not many definitive sequences have
been worked out.

The balance with the top-left corner is usually the main factor
in choosing this pincer.

White 2 is used with friendly forces backing it up. Its purpose
is to prevent a pincer. Locally it results in a loss, but may
be appropriate fuseki strategy. 

It was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but is not
seen often nowadays, having been replaced by the one-space high
approach, with which it has points in common.

Black responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c' or 'd *'. Black
may also play elsewhere 'e'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The great master Honinbo Shuei (1852-1906) favored the two-space
high (niken taka-gakari) approach, especially in two stone handicap
games. This approach move was very popular in the 1910s. Wu Qingyuan = Go Seigen
frequently played this way, considering it a good "whole board"
approach. In recent years, O Rissei has often used the two-space
high approach.

Almost all variations have been completely explored. 

Black plays 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd', 'e *', elsewhere ('f')
or 'k'.
'd' secures the corner, but is submissive. 'g' attaches to a
weak stone, forcing it to strengthen. 'h' is an overplay. 'j'
is not recommended.

Black 3 is peaceful. Black 3 was common when this approach move
was first played, but no longer.

White 'c' erases aji in the corner for White.

If there is already a Black stone on the triangled position like
in the Chinese Fuseki, White 1 was maybe doubtful. 'd' shows
punishment variation to be compared with the 'a' variations.

The 5-4 approach move has become more popular in modern times,
as modern Go emphasizes speed and influence.

Black responds at 'a *', 'b *', 'c', 'd *', 'e *', 'f *', 'h', 'i *', 'j *', 'k', 'l', 'm', or plays elsewhere 'o'.
If Black is in the top left corner with a low shimari at the triangled point, Black should not pincer, but play at 'a *'.
If Black is in the top left corner with a high shimari at the squared point, Black should not extend, but play at 'f *'

'a' also covers  the development in the Chinese Fuseki.
Black 'n' is slow.
'g' is a rare move, undecided between the two intentions of putting
pressure on White like with 'f' or influencing the top left side
like with 'h',

Black 3 is the most orthodox reply to White 2.

White continues with 'a *', 'b *' or 'e'. 

White 'b' leads to the avalanche pattern, which has complex variations.
Black has the initial choice of joseki with this pattern. The
outcome is typically Black gets the corner and out on the side,
White thickness.

White may also play elsewhere ('c'). 

White 'd' is sometimes played in amateur games.

White 'e' is played by professionals who don't want an immediate
decision which joseki shall be played.

Black can respond 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd *'.
Black 'a' is peaceful;
'b' avoids all complications;
'c' is the small avalanche = ko-nadare;
Black 'd', White 'c' gives the large avalanche = oo-nadare.

Black must have the ladder to play 'c'.

After 'c' there are no more simplifying variations, but the small
avalanche isn't too complicated.
After 'd' there are many complications, but White still can choose
a simplifying variation.

About the large avalanche joseki, Takemiya Masaki 9P spoke to
Jan van der Steen: "I will never play nadare in my life again.
I don't like large scale joseki since it's complicated and it
settles too much of the board. For beginners I recommend just
to play the simple variation ('b')."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Black 3 is a relatively modern invention. It is a severe move
which restricts White's movements.
It's also a punishment if White 2 was wrong because Black has additional stone on the triangled position like in the Kobayashi Fuseki.

White responds with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd' (joseki).
One of the variations after 'c' is called "the magic sword of
Muramasa". Although its joseki are not difficult, its mistake
refutations are hair-raising.
White 'd' was considered inferior until a new joseki variation
was developed.

White 'e' is unfavorable with this pincer, as the pincer is in
the way of White's extension.

Var 5 ('f') shows White playing elsewhere (which is rare).

'g' is not recommended.

'h' is inferior.

'i' is a special strategy, if White has something like the High
Chinese Fuseki on the lower side..

g7, f6, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1

joseki outcomes:
a1 - Black right, White top
b2 - Black choice of right or top
c3 - Black choice or right or top
d6 - Black top, White right, each side has a group on the run
e4 - Black right

the right side on 'E', 'F', 'G' or 'H'.

The star or hoshi (4-4) point, emphasizing influence at the potential
expense of territory.

The first experiments with the star point were around 1840 in
Japan; its first appearances in pro games date to the early 1900's.
Its rise to preeminence came during the 'New Fuseki' movement
in Japan in the mid-1930's.

White approaches with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd *'. White 'a'
is the standard approach move, the variations after it cover
the great majority of hoshi joseki.
Other approaches invite a local loss, but may make sense strategically.

'e' covers White playing elsewhere. These variations show White
approaches when there are multiple Black stones locally.

'f' shows the too early sansan invasion (which is not joseki).

'g *' shows a splitting move (esp. when Black has already played at
the top).

'h' is feasible if strategically sensible.

'i' is a move on the side preparing to approach from the other
side.

'j', 'k' and 'l' are covered in another branching.

The variations after 'a *' and 'b *' should be studied together
to understand similarities and differences.

'c *' leads to much more complications than the other answers,
but White can simplify.

'd' is called Tsuke-Nobi-Joseki. Its shape also occurs on the
side without corner. Kyu and low dan players should totally avoid
playing this variation, regard it as bad move and instead play an
extension (a - c) or a pincer.

Black needs the ladder for 'e *'. An additional stone on  n  is also very helpful.

'f' is not generally favorable for Black, nor joseki. 'f' is better than 'i', if there's a Black stone on the triangled point.

'j', 'k' and 'l' show special strategies based upon the fuseki.

'o' shows Black ignoring the approach move (White 2) and invasion into different extensions and moyos based on the Hoshi.

'p' shows the greedy play of using the star point immediately
for territory.

'q' is possible if White is not on the top side.

'r' is a trick play.

's' is covered in two other branches.

White responses range from 'a' to 'f *' or 'l' or 'n'.

White may also play elsewhere ('g').

If White already has a stone on the triangled point, he may slide
to 'h *', 'i *' or 'j *'.

'k' and 'm' are invasions.

'n' can be more preferable than 'c' in six stone handicap games.

White continues with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *' to 'g *' or 'j'. White 'd', the nose contact play, is a trick play.

Black 3 is the most complicated answer to the White approach.
To avoid all variations, players who don't know them treat the
position as if Black had played the keima instead and continue
on 'h'. This involves only a minor loss of territorial balance
for sake of simplicity.

'i' is a mistake.

Nikken Basami = Dukan Hyeopgong = E`r Jia = 2-Space Low Pincer
---------------------------------------------------------------

Black 3, the two-space low pincer, at best indicates a special
strategy. 

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space
pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most
often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the
same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is
less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer,
if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely
to later come under attack if White establishes a base for White
2.

White continues with 'a' to 'c'.

'd' continues on the right side against a Black komoku. In this branch is explained, when Black 3 is to be applied.

White 'e' and 'f' are not recommended.

Mokuhazushi = Waemok = Wai`mu` = 5-3 Point
---------------------------------------------------

The mokuhazushi (5-3) point was popular in the Edo period in
Japan (1600 - 1867). It emphasizes influence; territorially,
it is inferior to the 3-4 point. 

Approach moves for White range from 'a *', 'b *' or 'c *'. White
'a' is typical.

After 'a', the 5-3 point can lead to different complicated joseki:
the taisha and the near low pincer. Both can be avoided or simplified.

White 'b' forfeits the corner, and emphasizes the right side,
so locally this is disadvantageous for White. 

White 'c' leads to a division of profit for White and influence
for Black. A ladder helps when playing White 'c'.

White 'd' is played by amateurs who don't know 3,5-point-joseki
and professionals in situations where an equal result in this
corner is unimportant. 'd' is inferior to 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

White 'e' can be played as part of center-moyo-strategy, but
is not joseki, but more like playing a reduction after tenuki
once.

After White plays tenuki 'f', Black can choose between two shimari
and a trick play.

Komoku Kakari
-----------------

White 2 is the standard approach because of its solidity and
stability.

Black replies with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *', 'f *',
'g *', 'h *', 'i *', 'j'

Black 'd' is strategically correct, if there is a Black stone
on the triangled, a White stone on the squared point.

The most difficult of all joseki is the taisha 'i'. Once Black
has played this move, he has only one inferior move to simplify.
So, if he doesn't know the '1000 variations', he may well choose
one of the five pincers, who are much easier. But if he knows
them and White does not, White need not fear Black 'i', because
he still has several opportunities to avoid the complex variations
with an equal or well acceptable result.
'e' is the most complicated of the five pincers, you may well
learn it at least. White can simplify.

'k' is a mistake.

The choice between the three and four-space extension is mainly
influenced by the position in the top-left corner. White has
no particularly severe attack against the wider extension.

White can answer at 'a *', 'b *' through 'd *', 'e *' or play
elsewhere (f).

The maximum extension for Black. Black's choice of this extension
is influenced by the position in the top-left corner.

White can answer 'a *', 'b *' or 'c'. Playing elsewhere is ot
favorable, as Black can make effective use of this five-space
extension. This is a relaxed extension so there are no fierce

Ikken Basami = Hankan Hyeopgong = Yi Jia = 1-Space Low Pincer
--------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of playing the close pincer of Black 3 is mainly to build
influence on the right. Therefore a Black position in the lower
right corner is desirable when making this pincer.

White replies range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *' or 'e'. White
'a' is most popular. The other moves indicate a special strategy.

White cannot play elsewhere, as Black 'a' gives White a very
unfavorable result.

White 'e' is the simplifying variation. It gives a secure corner
territory for influence and sente. It isn't considers joseki,
because, White gets completely surrounded.

The takamoku (high) point (5-4). With its emphasis on influence,
the 5-4 point complements the 4-4 (hoshi) point in creating an
influence-oriented fuseki.

White approaches with 'a *' or 'b'. White 'b *' is played when
Black has support at the top.

After White play tenuki 'c', Black can choose a shimari.

orientation of the 5-4, but also the most complicated one.

popularity because the 4-4 hoshi (star) point strikes a better
balance between influence and territory. As one can see from
